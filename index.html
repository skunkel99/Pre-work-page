                    Hey everyone! My name is Sarah Kunkel and I am a rising Junior at the University of Michigan majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Economics. I am really interested in how we can use technology and programming to better our world. I think that many people have mixed feelings about how big of a presence technology has in our society currently, but I believe that if used properly, we can create new softwares that really increase the quality of life for our world.

                    At school, I am work on a student team called blueLab to develop an app for a local sustaianability non-profit, and I am also the finance chair for this org. I also am a photographer for the school newspaper. I came to Ix because I want to learn more real-world skills that are often over looked in the classroom. I have only ever coded in C++, so I am excited to be exposed to other languages and learn how to adapt the knowledge that I already have. I also think that Ix will help me prepare for the upper level classes I will start taking next semester.
                    </p>

                    Before coming to Ixperience, I went on a trip with my sister to a few cities in Europe. Here are some pictures!
